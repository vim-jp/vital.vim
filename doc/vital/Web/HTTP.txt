------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS				*Vital.Web.HTTP-functions*

get({url} [, {param} [, {header}]])	*Vital.Web.HTTP.get()*
	Send a GET request to the server.
	This is just a wrapper of |Vital.Web.HTTP.request()|.

post({url} [, {param} [, {header}]])	*Vital.Web.HTTP.post()*
	Send a POST request to the server.
	This is just a wrapper of |Vital.Web.HTTP.request()|.

request({settings})			*Vital.Web.HTTP.request()*
request({url} [, {settings}])
request({method}, {url} [, {settings}])
	Send a request to the server.
	This function requires one of the clients, "curl" or "wget".
	{settings} is a |Dictionary| which contains the following items:

		HTTP Method, such as GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH.

	"param"		Default: (None)
		GET parameters.  This is a string or a dictionary.
		If dictionary, it is converted to a string by
		|Vital.Web.HTTP.encodeURI()|.
		This is appended to url.

	"data"		Default: (None)
		POST data.  This is a string, a list, or a dictionary.
		If it is a dictionary, it is converted to a string by
		|Vital.Web.HTTP.encodeURI()|.

	"headers"	Default: (None)
		Request headers.  This is a dictionary.

	"contentType"	Default: (None)

	"retry"		Default: 1
		Maximum number of retries.

	"client"	Default: ["python", "curl", "wget",
					"python3", "python2"]
		Candidate list of HTTP client to use for a request.
		The first available one is used.
		A string as an HTTP client is also possible.
		See also |Vital.Web.HTTP-client|.

	"command"
		Command name for a client.  You should use with "client".
		This is a |Dictionary| that has client name as key and has the
		command as value.
		This maybe becomes like the following. >
		{
		  "curl": "/usr/bin/curl",
		  "wget": "/usr/local/bin/wget",
		}
<
	"authMethod"	Default: (None)
		(This is only valid for "curl" interface.)
		Specify the authorization method.
		The value must be in ['basic', 'digest', 'ntlm', 'negotiate',
